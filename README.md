### Credits
A lot of good ideas about how to work with ECS in ClojureScript and otherwise were gleaned from the following projects (in no particular order):
* [lovetoys](https://github.com/lovetoys/lovetoys)
* [ezglib](https://github.com/bakpakin/ezglib)
* [tiny-ecs](https://github.com/bakpakin/tiny-ecs)
* [asteroids](https://github.com/johntrimble/asteroids)
* [chocolatier](https://github.com/alexkehayias/chocolatier)
* [enoki](https://github.com/harto/enoki)

Also, I learned a lot about ECS architecture from [Richard Lord's blog](http://www.richardlord.net/). Specifically, these entries: 
* [Ash â€“ a new entity system framework for Actionscript games](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/introducing-ash)
* [What is an entity system framework for game development?](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/what-is-an-entity-framework)
* [Why use an entity system framework for game development?](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/why-use-an-entity-framework)
